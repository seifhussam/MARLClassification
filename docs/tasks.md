# Tasks

The Definition of Done for each task is to write an experiment documentation in the format of the [experiment template](./experiments/experiement_template.md).

## Week 1: 23-10-2024 to 29-10-2024

- Task-1: Increase the observation window size to X and run the experiment. [Pedro]
- Task-2: Increase the number of agents to Y and run the experiment. [Joao]
- Task-3: Increase the Communcation time to Z: [1,3,5,7,9] and run the experiment. [Seif] (try even number, and T=18.)
- Task-4: Modify the current implementation of the repo to match the network described in the paper. [David] (try more agents or more window size)


## Week 2: 29-10-2024 to 05-11-2024
Carryover:
- Task-1: Increase the observation window size to X and run the experiment. [Pedro]
- Document findings in the experiment template. [Joao, Seif and David]
  
New Tasks:
- Task-5: Try even numbers for the Communcation time. [6,8] [Seif]
- Task-6: Try more agents or increase window size. [David]
- Task-7: Try new step directions for moving diagonally. actions=[[1,1],[-1,-1],[1,-1],[-1,1]] [JOAO]
- Task-8: Investigate changing rewards according to action. [Whoever has capacity]
- Task-9: Investigate if random actions are implemented in the code. (ref: fig 6 from the paper) [David]
