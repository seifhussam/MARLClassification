# Tasks

The Definition of Done for each task is to write an experiment documentation in the format of the [experiment template](./experiments/experiement_template.md).

## Week 1: 23-10-2024 to 29-10-2024

- Task-1: Increase the observation window size to X and run the experiment. [Pedro]
- Task-2: Increase the number of agents to Y and run the experiment. [Joao]
- Task-3: Increase the Communcation time to Z: [1,3,5,7,9] and run the experiment. [Seif] (try even number, and T=18.)
- Task-4: Modify the current implementation of the repo to match the network described in the paper. [David] (try more agents or more window size)


## Week 2: 29-10-2024 to 05-11-2024
Carryover:
- Task-1: Increase the observation window size to X and run the experiment. [Pedro]
- Document findings in the experiment template. [Joao, Seif and David]
  
New Tasks:
- Task-5: Try even numbers for the Communcation time. [6,8] [Seif]
- Task-6: Try more agents or increase window size. [David]
- Task-7: Try new step directions for moving diagonally. actions=[[1,1],[-1,-1],[1,-1],[-1,1]] [Joao]
- Task-8: Investigate changing rewards according to action. [Whoever has capacity]
- Task-9: Investigate if random actions are implemented in the code. (ref: fig 6 from the paper) [David] --> there is no implementation of random actions in the code.

## Week 3: 05-11-2024 to 12-11-2024
Carryover:
- Task-1: Increase the observation window size to [4, 6, 8, 16, 28] and run the experiment. [Pedro]
- Document findings in the experiment template. [Task-2, Task-4, Task-6, Task-7]
- Task-8: Investigate changing rewards according to action. [João]

New Tasks:
- Task-10: Investigate another dataset for the experiment. [Seif]
- Task-11: Investigate stopping/resuming training (to mimic the training paper described in the paper). [David]
- Task-12: Investigate the effect of stopping communication. [Pedro]
- Task-13: Add a bool flag to enable/disable message reciever. [David]

## Week 4: 12-11-2024 to 19-11-2024

Notes:
- Task-12 was done by David and Task-11 will be reassigned to Pedro 

Carryover:
- Task-1: Increase the observation window size to [4, 6, 8, 16, 28] and run the experiment. [Pedro]
- Document findings in the experiment template. [Task-7] [João]
- Task-8: Investigate changing rewards according to action. [João]
- Task-10: Investigate another dataset (SEMEION) for the experiment. [Seif]
- Task-12: Run David's branch with non-communication [Seif] + Documenting the experiment [David]
- Task-11: Investigate stopping/resuming training (to mimic the training paper described in the paper). [Pedro]

New Tasks:
- Task-14: Start working on the final report. (ask about the report template) [David starts and everyone contributes]
- Task-15: Start working on the final presentation. (deadline 8th of December) [Seif starts and everyone contributes]
